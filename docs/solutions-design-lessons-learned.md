# _Solutions Design Lessons Learned_ 
Few raw thoughts to remind me what to avoid in designing software solutions: 

- Don’t build a solution on not verified assumptions.
- Don’t build solutions that take into account plans. The future may never come, and solutions produce on those assumptions are much more fragile.
- Build solutions to understand how it works and does not require reverse engineering when you get amnesia.
- Build solutions that take responsibility of people into account and design system in a way that when a system X does not work, it affects only give team, not other teams
